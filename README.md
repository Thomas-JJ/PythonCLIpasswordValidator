# PythonCLIpasswordValidator
This is a class project I executed using Python to validate a users password.
Featured in this example is the transition from High Level requirements you may get from a client to a detailed specification that would be submitted for approval to the development team. 
Using that specificiation I was able to easily build a program and verify/validate it worked as expected.
